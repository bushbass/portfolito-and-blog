As part of a remote team via Chingu corhots, we desgined and built and app that took a search term from user input and returned an associated picture from the Unsplash API and associated quote from the PaperQuotes API. Unfortunately, it appears our API key is no longer working for the quote API. Finding a new quote API to repair this app is on my to do list.
