          I've loved computers for a long time. Although I studied music in
          college, I worked as a web developer for a few years. Since then, I've
          tried out a few other career paths, but I've always come back to web
          development. Not long ago I decided to try to keep pace with the new
          technologies in web development and I've been doing projects to
          showcase my skills.{" "}

            I have a YouTube channel
          </a>{" "}
          where I talk about web development and I've even given a few talks at
          a local freeCodeCamp Meetup group.{" "}

          HTML and CSS are the mainstays of course, but I've really come to love
          JavaScript and React. I'm not a Node expert but I can get a REST API
          running with Express.

          I've been at home taking care of the kids the past few years but now
          I'm ready to make a move back into full-time. Ideally I'd like to be
          working in music/entertainment or education (I spent a few years
          teaching music), but I would be very happy working anywhere that has a
          supportive team and that will allow me to continue learning and
          growing my skills.{" "}

          Iâ€™m currently living almost in the country, in northwest New Jersey,
          the Garden State. Wife, two kids, a two dogs and a cat. I love my
          vegetable garden (and attempting to keep the deer out of it) and my
          wife and I are tyring our best to maintain a healthy lifestyle. We try
          to keep in shape so our yearly Spartan Race is not that tough on us
          (we even have the kids into the mud races too!).
